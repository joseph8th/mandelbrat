Overview
========

MandelBrat* (`mbrat`) is a Linux explorer for Mandelbrot Set-based fractal key crytographic services -- called SPIs to follow the Java Security API convention.

Both the Mandelbrot Set explorer and crypto functionality may be accessed either from the command line, or via built-in GUI (Gtk+ 3).

* This version is pre-release of an eventual alpha version, and not everything is implemented.


Installation
============

Notes 
-----

- `setup.py` currently has limited use to building the extension module.
- `mbrat` would like to install in your $HOME/.config/ directory, and will make one if needed.
- `git <http://git-scm.com/download/linux>`_ and `python2.7` are required to install and run.
- `boost <http://www.boost.org/users/download/>`_, `mpfr <http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/#download>`, and `gmp <http://gmplib.org/>` libraries are required on your include path.
- There is no systemwide install because this is a crypto program. Users are isolated.

Procedure
---------

Execute the following statements in your shell (do _not_ type the prompt, `$`) ::

  $ git clone https://github.com/joseph8th/mandelbrat.git
  $ cd mandelbrat
  $ ./mbrat-install


Usage
=====

mbrat command [options]

MandelBrat may be used either from your shell (the command line terminal of your Linux OS) or via a graphical user interface (GUI) if Gtk+ 3.0 is installed on your computer.

To run MandelBrat from the command line, run the following and then choose a command::

  $ mbrat --help

To run the MandelBrat GUI, run the following command::

  $ mbrat gui

-----------------

MandelBrat - Mandelbrot Set-based crypto explorer

VERSION: 0.1g [Git-dev]

USAGES:
        $ mbrat gui
        $ mbrat -h

DESCRIPTION:

    This version is not fully functional. The cryptographic algorithms are not implemented here.
These are being developed with their own interfaces, so they may be implemented via other crypto
packages as well (i.e., openssl, /dev/crypto, JavaSec SPIs, etc).

Expect these features starting with v1.0.
