MandelBrat - Mandelbrot Set-based crypto explorer

VERSION: 0.1g [Git-dev]

USAGES:
        $ mbrat gui
        $ mbrat -h

DESCRIPTION:

    This version is not fully functional. The cryptographic algorithms are not implemented here.
These are being developed with their own interfaces, so they may be implemented via other crypto
packages as well (i.e., openssl, /dev/crypto, JavaSec SPIs, etc).

Expect these features starting with v1.0.
